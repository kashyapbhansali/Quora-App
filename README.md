# Quora-App
Windows Phone App called "Quora-Client". This was my starter project to learn  Windows Phone App development. 
The app is made using C#, XAML & Visual Studio. Supported Windows Phone OS 7.x/8.x

Intergrated Adduplex with this application to gain insights about the performance of the app. 
The App had highest number of ratings from United States, India, China and UK.

3500+ users downloaded and used the applciation, with 120+ daily users and an Avg. rating of 4 stars.
All of this within 2 months of launching the application on Windows store. 
The app was live for 2months before it was taken down due to copyright issues.
